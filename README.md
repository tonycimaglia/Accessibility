# Accessibilty

## What is it?

#### Accessibility at its core?

Making sure that all users have equal access to the information and functionality of your site.

The users that we're mainly referring to when we discuss a11y (abbrevation) are those with physical impairments. It can also refer to users on mobile devices or people using slow internet connections.

Accessible sites are designed designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them

#### How many people are disabled in the world?

- Numbers are variable, but it's about 1.15 billion people according to WHO.
- vision alone - roughly 300 million

They have different ways that they perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web.

How do people with disabilities navigate the web differently?

Keyboard only (reduced dexterity)

Screen readers (vision)

Captions for videos (hearing impaired)

## Why should you care?

- access to the web is a human basic human right
- improve peoples lives
- bottom lines (more users, great optics)
- legal implications (ADA)

## Writing Accessible Code

Lots of guides published in the 90s

Brought together in the Unified Web Site Accessibility Guidelines compiled at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison

W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)

Version 8 becomes WCAG 1.0

WCAG 2.1 (Current)

4 Principles - examples of a few from each section

### Percievable

#### People can see or hear the content

- meaningful alt text (helps seo)
- making sure form elements are labeled (labels can be hidden, screen readers will grasp at straws for text to read)
- good contrast
- removing titles from links

## Operable

#### Users must be able to control UI elements using something

- Page navigation and liks work using Only a keyborad
- Enough Time
- Seizures are bad. <3 a second
- Obvious link text

## Understandable

#### information and the operation of user interface must be understandable

- no tiny font
- keep nav in same order
- clearly identify form errors
- Don't be Ling's Cars...

### Robust

#### content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies

- no errors (parsing) https://validator.w3.org/
- WAI-ARIA roles for custom elements

### Quick Improvements

    html
    headings - (defined hierarchy)
    css
    focus colors (people love removing this!)
    js
    skip links (github) (webAim)

## Conducting a Manual Accessibility Check

- Tab through your site's experience.
  are there off screen elements that are in the tab order? (menu hidden on certain width, etc.)
  - Make sure the site doesn't have focusable non-interactive content.
  - Remove / disable offscrren content from the tab order
- run through it with a screen reader
- run through the contrast of the site through wave

## Automating Accessibility Checks

### Tools to get you started

WAVE - 20 years (the standard)

- https://wave.webaim.org/

#### Lighthouse

- https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse

operable - use by typing or by voice
understandable - clear and simple language
Robust - people can use different assistive technologies
ATAG - CMS / code editors, etc
UAAG - web browsers / media players
